# GregTech0
The original Lightning Rod Addon for Singleplayer Minecraft 1.2.5. Requires IC2 Version 1.103.
More Details on the Release Page https://github.com/GregTech6/GregTech0/releases/tag/v1.0.0

# Description
This is the old Lightning Rod Addon for IC², the first thing Greg has ever created in regards of Minecraft Mods, and the beginning of GregTech itself.
It does 8 388 608 EU at a rate of 8192 EU/t once struck by Lightning, you will need 4 HV Transformers around it in order to grab all Energy it emits.
Lightning Strikes happen on a random chance depending how many IC² Iron Fences you place ontop of the Main Block and on how tall the overall Rod is (Bedrock to Height Limit is most efficient).
The generated Power is not subject to actual Lightning strikes, you cant just cause a Lightning Strike with a special Arrow or something, that won't work.

This Version works ONLY in Singleplayer, this was a time where Greg had no Idea how to do Networking in MC, but its the only Version where this is the case. ;)
